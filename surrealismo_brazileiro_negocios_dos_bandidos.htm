            que ponto chegou o Brazil. Richard Adams, da coluna City diary, 
            diz que a crise econômica na América do Sul está 
            prejudicando até os negócios dos bandidos. &quot;No 
            Brasil, quando a mulher de um empresário foi seqüestrada 
            na cidade de Americana, os seqüestradores exigiram um resgate 
            de cinco mil libras em dinheiro vivo. Mas - devido ao estado da 
            economia - seu marido não tinha esse dinheiro. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Depois de várias horas 
            de negociações, foi feito um acordo. O marido entregou 
            um aparelho de som estéreo, um forno de microondas, algumas 
            jóias, um telefone celular e cinco cheques pré-datados 
            no valor total de cinco mil libras, pagáveis nos próximos 
            cinco meses.&quot;</font></p>

                        to the Wall Street Journal, trying to shrug off its 
                        &quot;World Most Boring Newspaper 2001&quot; award (as 
                        voted by the readers of the Guardian, you may recall). 
                        Last Wednesday the Journal's European edition - which 
                        charges £1.20 to read all the best articles from 
                        the previous day's US edition - had a &quot;women in 
                        business&quot; focus, including a profile of &quot;Europe's 
                        25 most successful business women&quot;. An interesting 
                        list it was too: number one being Sari Baldauf, the 
                        president of Nokia Networks. The other 24 include luminaries 
                        such as Wanda Rapacyznski of Polish media giant Agora. 
                        Scanning through the list, one couldn't help feeling 
                        that someone was missing... the most high profile businesswoman 
                        in the UK, the only one running a FTSE-100 company... 
                        just made a dame. Marjorie Scardino - heard of her? 
                        Hmm? The chief executive of Pearson? You know, publishes 
                        the FT. Never mind, maybe she'll make it next year. 
                        Or perhaps during a month of Sundays. </font></p>

                        is also a German media group, is seeing its turkeys 
                        come home to roost. Kirch's number two, Dieter Hahn, 
                        was embarrassed during his talk at the FT's new media 
                        conference yesterday. Making a speech entitled &quot;New 
                        routes to value&quot; raised a few giggles, given Kirch's 
                        problems. &quot;Clearly I haven't had time to change 
                        my presentation to take into account events of recent 
                        weeks,&quot; said Hahn. &quot;I should have called it 
                        'New routes to debt'.&quot; </font></p>

                        few of its shareholders recently when it was discovered 
                        the company was under state investigation in the US 
                        - a fact that Wembley chose not to mention. Nigel Potter, 
                        Wembley's chief executive and a distant relative of 
                        Harry, was quizzed yesterday as to why the company had 
                        kept quiet about the investigation since last May. &quot;The 
                        reason we didn't do that was because we felt that that 
                        would have been misleading,&quot; said Potter. That's 
                        a triumph for transparent relations with investors.

                        struggles continue and even hoodlums are having trouble 
                        making a good living. In Brazil, when a businessman's 
                        wife was kidnapped in the city of Americana, the abductors 
                        demanded a ransom worth £5,000 cash. But - blame 
                        the state of the economy - her husband didn't have the 
                        money. After several hours of negotiation, a deal was 
                        struck. The husband handed over a stereo, a microwave 
                        oven, some jewellery, a mobile phone and five postdated 
                        cheques worth a total of £5,000, payable on each 
                        of the next five months. The lucky couple would then 
                        have cancelled the cheques, proving once again that 
                        crime does pay, but just not very well.</font><font face="Arial">
