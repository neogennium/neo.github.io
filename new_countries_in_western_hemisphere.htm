            new nations could emerge in the Americas </b></font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial">The creation of new countries in the Americas 
            could occur in the near future as the result of globalization, which 
            has energized a &quot;secessionist impulse&quot; that knows no geographical 
            boundaries, says Juan Enriquez, a former Mexican government official 
            who is now a researcher at Harvard University's David Rockefeller 
            Center for Latin American studies.<br> Writing in the just-released 
            Fall 1999 edition of &quot;Foreign Policy,&quot; a Washington quarterly 
            published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Enriquez 
            argues that &quot;most leaders throughout the Americas rarely consider 
            the possibility that their current borders may shrink or even disappear.&quot; 
            But he warns that the tide of secession that is &quot;sweeping across 
            the world today&quot; is not simply a product of ancient nationalist 
            impulses and catastrophic social unrest. Rather, he said, it is 
            being driven by globalization, &quot;which is breaking the world 
            down into its component parts, even as it is drawing these parts 
            closer today.&quot;<br> Enriquez' argument stands on solid ground, 
            says Miami Herald columnist Andres Oppenheimer. In a recent column, 
            Oppenheimer noted the trend of an ever-increasing number of countries 
            in the world. In 1914, Oppenheimer said, the world had 62 countries, 
            74 in 1946, and has 193 today.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Enriquez explains in his article, entitled 
            &quot;Too Many Flags,&quot; that the more globalized the world becomes, 
            the less traumatic it is for nationalists to split from their states. 
            Using the Canadian province of Quebec as an example, he said that 
            globalization implies that borders become more porous to goods, 
            ideas, capital, and people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;If it is just as easy for Quebec to 
            trade north-south, as it is east-west, Canada's market[s], not to 
            mention its laws and rules, are no longer essential to the province's 
            survival,&quot; Enriquez said. &quot;In fact, small countries and 
            national groups hoping to avoid domination by larger neighbors sometimes 
            find open borders their best ally.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Enriquez, who was a Mexican government peace 
            negotiator in Chiapas in the mid-1990s, said that so far, the Western 
            Hemisphere is the one segment of the world that has seemed immune 
            from secessionist impulses. Although the Caribbean Basin has continued 
            generating microstates, he said, the last new border to emerge in 
            the Americas was Panama in 1903 and before that El Salvador in 1841. 
            With the exception of Quebec, &quot;questioning flags, borders, 
            and anthems typically does not form part of the discourse of even 
            the most radical leaders in the hemisphere.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Despite that, Enriquez said, boundaries within 
            the hemisphere are neither as simple nor as stable as they appear. 
            The U.S.-Mexico land border, he said, changed as recently as 1963, 
            and the current maritime border between the two countries was only 
            approved by Congress in 1997. Newfoundland &quot;reluctantly&quot; 
            left the United Kingdom to join Canada in 1949. Part of France's 
            border, represented by St. Pierre and Miquelon, lies less than 15 
            miles off the Canadian coast. Quebec may separate, &quot;perhaps 
            leading to the dissolution of Canada.&quot;<br> For the future, 
            Enriquez said, certain regions within large countries not only may 
            be viable as separate states but also may be far more productive 
            when unbundled from their traditional borders.&quot; Within the 
            Americas, he said, relatively wealthy areas such as western Canada, 
            northern Mexico, southern Brazil, and Guayaquil in Ecuador have 
            &quot;voices of dissent within their boundaries asking what benefit 
            they derive from their national identities.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">This development, he said, has coincided with 
            the end of import substitution, industrialization and the opening 
            of borders. Countries and regions now depend on global, not local, 
            markets.<br> In that regard, Enriquez said a nation's success in 
            the global economy is not determined by the quantity of its natural 
            resources, but by the quality of its human resources. Thus, he said, 
            &quot;if the key to prosperity is a citizenry with a high degree 
            of education and entrepreneurship, some regions may decide that 
            retaining ties to areas that are underdeveloped and prone to conflict 
            is not a good long-term strategy.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Within Latin America, Enriquez writes, &quot;many 
            voices&quot; are questioning the status quo, including Mapuches 
            in Chile, Mayans throughout Chiapas and Central America, and descendants 
            of the Incas in Peru and Ecuador. In addition, he said, protests 
            and demands for autonomy are growing in the Guatemalan highlands 
            as well as among Brazil's landless. Politicians in northern Mexico 
            and Sao Paulo, Brazil, are increasingly vocal in their demands for 
            local autonomy and fiscal control. Enriquez said.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Each group is asking, he said, &quot;what 
            benefits it gets from belonging to a state that does not deliver 
            what it promises. None of these movements begins or matures by advocating 
            the splitting of the country or the rejection of flag and anthem. 
            But redressing old grievances or contemporary needs, if mishandled, 
            can eventually lead to escalating demands for autonomy and even 
            separation.&quot;<br> </font></p>
